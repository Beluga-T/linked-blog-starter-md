## **10. Key Questions and Answers**

### ðŸ”¹ What are the major differences between landscapes and rocks of the Colorado Plateau and those of the Cascades geologic province?
- **Colorado Plateau**: Horizontal sedimentary layers, deep canyons (e.g., Grand Canyon), minimal volcanism.
- **Cascades**: Volcanically active, stratovolcanoes (e.g., Mt. Rainier, Crater Lake), steep, young mountains.

### ðŸ”¹ What is the energy source behind the motion of tectonic plates?
- **Convection currents** in the Earth's mantle drive the motion of tectonic plates.

### ðŸ”¹ Why do earthquakes and volcanoes occur in linear patterns?
- Because they occur **along plate boundaries**, which are typically linear (e.g., subduction zones, transform faults).

### ðŸ”¹ What processes occur along subduction zones?
- **Oceanic plate subducts** beneath continental plate â†’ trench formation â†’ magma generation â†’ volcanic arcs.

### ðŸ”¹ What geographic features are found at subduction zones?
- **Deep-sea trenches**, **volcanic arcs**, **earthquake zones**, and **mountain chains**.

### ðŸ”¹ What drives explosive eruptions of stratovolcanoes?
- **Silica-rich magma** traps gases â†’ pressure builds â†’ explosive eruption.

### ðŸ”¹ What is pyroclastic debris?
- Fragments of rock and ash **ejected during explosive volcanic eruptions**, including lapilli and volcanic bombs.

### ðŸ”¹ What is the age and dominant component of Mt. Rainier?
- **cenozoic (50,000 yrs)**, dominated by **andesitic lava and pyroclastic material**.

### ðŸ”¹ How do alpine glaciers work?
- Ice forms in **zone of accumulation** and melts in **zone of ablation**. Movement depends on snow input and melt rates.

### ðŸ”¹ What is a major volcanic hazard of Mt. Rainier?
- **Lahars (volcanic mudflows)** formed when ice/snow melts rapidly during eruptions.

### ðŸ”¹ How does Crater Lakeâ€™s eruption differ from others in the Cascades?
- It formed a **caldera** (not just a cone), after collapse of **Mt. Mazama** following a massive eruption.

### ðŸ”¹ What controls volcanism in the Cascades?
- The **Cascadia Subduction Zone**, where the **Juan de Fuca Plate** subducts under the North American Plate.

### ðŸ”¹ How is Lassen Volcanic NP different from other Cascade parks?
- Composed of **lava domes and cinder cones**, recent eruption in 1915, extensive **hydrothermal features**.

### ðŸ”¹ What is the difference between ancestral and modern Sierra Nevada?
