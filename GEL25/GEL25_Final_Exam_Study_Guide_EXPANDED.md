## **1. Plate Tectonics & Volcanism**

### ðŸ”¹ Key Concepts:
- **Plate Tectonics**: Movement driven by convection currents in Earth's mantle.
- **Plate Boundaries**: 
  - *Convergent* (subduction zones)
  - *Divergent* (spreading ridges)
  - *Transform* (strike-slip faults)
- **Subduction Zones**: Create volcanic arcs and deep ocean trenches.
- **Volcanic Features**:
  - **Stratovolcanoes**: Tall, explosive (e.g., Mt. Rainier)
  - **Calderas**: Collapse of magma chambers post-eruption (e.g., Crater Lake)
  - **Pyroclastic Eruptions**: Violent, ash-heavy explosions

### ðŸ”¹ National Parks:
- **Cascades (e.g., Mt. Rainier, Crater Lake, Lassen)**:
  - Associated with Cascadia Subduction Zone
  - Volcanism includes lava flows, ash fall, pyroclastic flows, lahars
- **Crater Lake NP**:
  - Formed ~7,700 years ago from collapse of Mt. Mazama
- **Lassen Volcanic NP**:
  - Notable for 1915 eruption, domes, hydrothermal features

## **2. Sierra Nevada & Yosemite**

### ðŸ”¹ Geologic Framework:
- **Granite Batholiths**: Cooled magma from ancestral subduction (Mesozoic)
- **Uplift Types**:
  - *Ancestral Sierra Nevada*: Created from Farallon plate subduction
  - *Modern Sierra Nevada*: Fault-block uplift

### ðŸ”¹ Geomorphic Processes:
- **Jointing & Exfoliation**: Dome formations (e.g., Half Dome)
- **Glaciation Effects**:
  - U-shaped valleys
  - Hanging valleys
  - Glacial polish & erratics

---

## **3. Metamorphic Rocks & Glaciation**

### ðŸ”¹ Rock Types:
- **Slate â†’ Schist â†’ Gneiss**: Increasing metamorphic grade
- Found in **Sequoiaâ€“Kings Canyon NP**

### ðŸ”¹ Glacial Processes:
- **Erosion**:
  - *Plucking*: Ice lifts fractured rock
  - *Abrasion*: Rocks embedded in ice scrape bedrock
- **Landforms**:
  - Cirques, arÃªtes, tarns, paternoster lakes

---

## **4. Colorado Plateau & Grand Canyon**

### ðŸ”¹ Features:
- Flat-lying sedimentary layers
- Deep canyon incision by rivers (e.g., Colorado River in Grand Canyon)
- Redrock landscapes, escarpments, mesas

### ðŸ”¹ Time Perspective:
- Grand Canyon reveals rock layers spanning over 1.8 billion years
- Ideal location to explore *deep time*

---

## **5. Basin and Range & Death Valley**

### ðŸ”¹ Tectonics:
- **Extensional Stress**: Produces normal faults and block-fault mountains
- **Basin & Range**: Characterized by internal drainage (Great Basin)

### ðŸ”¹ Death Valley Geology:
- **Wind Erosion**: Desert pavement, dunes
- **Water Erosion**: Alluvial fans, playas, flash flood debris flows
- **Rain Shadow**: Creates extreme aridity

---

## **6. Rocky Mountains & Glacier NP**

### ðŸ”¹ Formation:
- **Laramide Orogeny (~80â€“55 Ma)**: Flat-slab subduction drove inland uplift
- Rocks of **Glacier NP**: Precambrian-aged sedimentary rocks with features like mudcracks and ripple marks

---

## **7. Yellowstone Hotspot**

### ðŸ”¹ Supervolcano System:
- **Caldera Eruptions**: Multiple explosive events over the past 2 million years
- **Hydrothermal Features**: Geysers, hot springs, sinter terraces

---

## **8. San Andreas Fault System**

### ðŸ”¹ Plate Boundary:
- **Transform Fault**: Right-lateral strike-slip between Pacific and North American plates

### ðŸ”¹ Notable Sites:
- **Pinnacles NP**: Volcanic rocks displaced >200 miles from origin
- **Point Reyes**: Granitic rocks from Sierra Nevada batholith displaced by faulting
- **Coastal Features**: Sea cliffs, arches, stacks, and estuaries from marine transgression
