#### Q1. Look up the word `space`, in WordNet. There are multiple senses for the noun. What  do you think about the granularity of sense division for this word? How well do you anticipate humans to be able to ground to the proper sense, provided a context of occurrence? Illustrate your answer with example sentences from the BNC.

I think the sense of division in the WordNet is too detail. It is a good point for most of time, However, there is some overlapping in definitions that seems unnecessary. 

Eg:  space as `(printing) a block of type without a raised letter` vs `(a blank character used to separate successive words in writing or printing)`. These two sense almost means the same. I don't think there is a need to divide.

Humans typically rely on context to ground the meaning of _space_ effectively. 
For instance (BNC Examples):
- "The astronauts walked in outer space without a tether" - The context of astronauts anchors this to `outer space`.
- "Within a short space of time referrals were regularly coming in." - "time" imply the space means `the interval between two times`
- "Your business cannot hope to succeed,’ she announced, her voice booming in the narrow space" - "booming" , "narrow" imply the space here means `an empty area (usually bounded in some way between things)` (prob in a narrow room).
