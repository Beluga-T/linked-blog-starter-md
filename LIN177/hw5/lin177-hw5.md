## Part 1: Finding 3 Different Lemmas with Surface Forms and Examples 

### Lemma 1: **compute** (verb.)
#### BNC Query term:`{compute/V}`
#### Surface Forms:

- `computed`: The increasing wind was expected to help the smaller boats, and the leaders for most of the race may be deposed when the handicaps are `computed`. 
- `computes`: To get a view of the object a viewpoint and direction must be stated, and the system then `computes` the required 2D projection.
- `computing`: `Computing` the Collections: The art of successful flea handling Lea Jones
### Lemma 2: **sad**  (Adj.)
#### BNC Query term:`{sad/A}`
#### Surface Forms:

- `sadder`: It is `sadder` now than it ever was, and the magic has gone.
- `saddest`: One of the `saddest` aspects of AIDS is the plight of children infected with HIV.
### Lemma 3: **break** (verb.)
#### BNC Query term:`{break/V}`
#### Surface Forms:

- `broke`: I'm sorry I `broke` you in sacrifice.
- `broken`: Could not stay long in the room with it, but the ice had been `broken`.

## Part 2: A surface form that may belong to two different lemmas with different parts of speech

### Surface Form: `charge`
