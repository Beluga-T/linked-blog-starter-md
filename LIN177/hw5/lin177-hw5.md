- `computed`: The increasing wind was expected to help the smaller boats, and the leaders for most of the race may be deposed when the handicaps are `computed`.

- `computerised`: Selected branches of travel agents Thomas Cook and AT May are using the `computerised` system, with the details of about 100 selected hotels.

```python
int x = 2
print x
