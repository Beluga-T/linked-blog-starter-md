## Astronomy Unit
1 AU = 1 astronomy unit = distance from earth to sun.
## Light year
distance of light speed travel a year.

## Parallax
Parallax refers toÂ the apparent shift in an object's position when viewed from two different vantage points, often used to measure distances in astronomy and create depth in visual media

``Angular to Physical size:`` $$ x = D \theta(\frac{2 \pi }{360^\degree})$$$$\frac{x}{2\pi Distance} = \frac{angular \ size}{360^\degree}$$

## Nature has four foundational force

Strong and Weak Nuclear forces have very short ranges ($<10^{-12}$)
Electromagnetic force has a long range , but astronomical object are not charged.

**Gravity** is the one that matters most for astronomy.

## key fact about G
G force due to an object is stronger when the object has a larger mass.

When an obj is spherical you can pretend that all the mass is concentrated in a single point at the center of the sphere
$$F_{g}  = G \frac{M_1M_2}{d^{2}}$$
___
## Momentum
Momentum = Mass $\times$ Velocity
- the momentum of an object cannot change unless an external force acts on it.
- the total momentum of interacting obj cannot changed unless external force is acting on them. 
Force = Mass $\times$ Acceleration
## Angular Momentum 
Angular Momentum = Mass $\times$ Velocity $\times$ distance
### Conservation of Angular Momentum

Angular Momentum = Mass $\times$ Velocity $\times$ distance
- rotating or orbiting obj have angular momentum
	- can only be changed if a torque is applied
	- torque = "twisting forces"

## Kepler's second law
equal areas in equal times


# Energy 
## Three types of energy
kinetic energy = E of motion
- $K = 1/2 mv^2$
- thermal energy (heat) - total Kinetic Energy
- the Kinetic energy of rapidly moving atoms in an object
- Temperature - average Kinetic Energy
potential energy = stored E
- Gravitational
- Electrical
- Mass Energy
	- E = $m c^2$
- Chemical potential energy
	- Energy is released by breaking chemical bonds
	- food
radiative energy : E carried by light

## Unit of E
1 Joule = $1kg\ m^2/s^2$ (E = 1/2 mv^2)
1 cal = 4184 J
1 erg = 1g cm2/s^2

## Facts of lights
- light in a vacuum always moves at the same speed of $c = 300,000 km/s$
- light can act both as a particle and as a wave.
	- a photon is a particle of light
- light us an ELECTROMAGNETIC wave.
- ELECTROMAGNETIC waves interact with charged particles.

## Wavelength
- units are cm(or nanometers or Angstroms)
## frequency 
- frequency is the num of waves passing any point each second.
## Speed
- km/s

## Energy
- units in J

## Properties of Light
wavelength and freq are inversely porp.$$\lambda = \frac{c}{f}$$
Energy and freq are directly proportional $$ E = hf$$
$$h = 6.6 \times 10^-34 j/sec$$
## The electromagnetic spectrum
- long wavelength are redder
- short wavelength are bluer

## making a spectrum
- A prism bends light of different wavelength by different angles producing the spectrum.
# Spectra
a spectrum is a map of how much light is emitted at each wavelength.
# Thermal radiation

## What is thermal radiation

- humans emit lights in infrared.
$$B_v(v,T ) = \frac{2hv^3}{c^2} \times \frac{1}{e^\frac{hv}{kt} - 1}$$

if its hotter, its peak is at a shorter wavelength. it has a higher surface brightness.

-  blue star  -> high temp star (18000k)

## why  hotter = bluer?
- E = X x kT
- higher temp <-> higher energy <-> shorter wavelength(bluer)
$$\lambda = \frac{hc}{E} = \frac{hc}{XkT} = 2900000 nm / T$$

$$\lambda_{peak} = 2900000 /T$$
- T in kelvin 
- lambda in nm
- Wien law hotter means a bluer peak

## Energy, Power, Flux
E : unit in J
Luminosity/Power: energy emitted per second
Units are Watts(W) 1 watt = 1 J/sec
Flux or surface brightness: power emitted per square meter $(W/m^2)$g

Luminosity is surface brightness multiplied by surface area

## Rule #2 of thermal radiation
If its hotter, it has a higher surface brightness.

Surface brightness = $\sigma T^4$
(hotter means higher surface brightness)
