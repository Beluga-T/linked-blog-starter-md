## Astronomy Unit
1 AU = 1 astronomy unit = distance from earth to sun.
## Light year
distance of light speed travel a year.

## Parallax
Parallax refers toÂ the apparent shift in an object's position when viewed from two different vantage points, often used to measure distances in astronomy and create depth in visual media

``Angular to Physical size:`` $$ x = D \theta(\frac{2 \pi }{360^\degree})$$$$\frac{x}{2\pi Distance} = \frac{angular \ size}{360^\degree}$$

## Nature has four foundational force

Strong and Weak Nuclear forces have very short ranges ($<10^{-12}$)
Electromagnetic force has a long range , but astronomical object are not charged.

**Gravity** is the one that matters most for astronomy.

## key fact about G
G force due to an object is stronger when the object has a larger mass.

When an obj is spherical you can pretend that all the mass is concentrated in a single point at the center of the sphere
$$F_{g}  = G \frac{M_1M_2}{d^{2}}$$
