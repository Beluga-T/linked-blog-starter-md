## Astronomy Unit
1 AU = 1 astronomy unit = distance from earth to sun.
## Light year
distance of light speed travel a year.

## Parallax
Parallax refers toÂ the apparent shift in an object's position when viewed from two different vantage points, often used to measure distances in astronomy and create depth in visual media

``Angular to Physical size:`` $$ x = D \theta(\frac{2 \pi }{360^\degree})$$$$\frac{x}{2\pi Distance} = \frac{angular \ size}{360^\degree}$$

However, distances within the Solar System get awkward with km

- The planets are much smaller than the distances between them
- Distance from the Sun to the Earth: 
  $d = 150,000,000 \text{km} = 1.5 \times 10^8 \text{km}$- So one approach is to use scientific notation
- Here is a case where we make up a new unit to deal with all of those zeros:$1 \text{AU} = \text{Sun-Earth distance} = 1.5 \times 10^8 \text{km}$
- The astronomical unit was originally conceived as the average of Earth's aphelion and perihelion $1.49597870700 \times 10^8 \text{km}$

## Nature has four foundational force

Strong and Weak Nuclear forces have very short ranges ($<10^{-12}$)
Electromagnetic force has a long range , but astronomical object are not charged.

**Gravity** is the one that matters most for astronomy.

## key fact about G
G force due to an object is stronger when the object has a larger mass.

When an obj is spherical you can pretend that all the mass is concentrated in a single point at the center of the sphere

$$F_{g}  = G \frac{M_1M_2}{d^{2}}$$
___
## Momentum
Momentum = Mass $\times$ Velocity
- the momentum of an object cannot change unless an external force acts on it.
- the total momentum of interacting obj cannot changed unless external force is acting on them. 
Force = Mass $\times$ Acceleration
## Angular Momentum 
Angular Momentum = Mass $\times$ Velocity $\times$ distance
### Conservation of Angular Momentum

Angular Momentum = Mass $\times$ Velocity $\times$ distance
- rotating or orbiting obj have angular momentum
	- can only be changed if a torque is applied
	- torque = "twisting forces"

## Kepler's second law
equal areas in equal times


# Energy 
## Three types of energy
kinetic energy = E of motion
- $K = 1/2 mv^2$
- thermal energy (heat) - total Kinetic Energy
- the Kinetic energy of rapidly moving atoms in an object
- Temperature - average Kinetic Energy
potential energy = stored E
- Gravitational
- Electrical
- Mass Energy
	- E = $m c^2$
- Chemical potential energy
	- Energy is released by breaking chemical bonds
	- food
radiative energy : E carried by light

## Unit of E
1 Joule = $1kg\ m^2/s^2$ (E = 1/2 mv^2)
1 cal = 4184 J
1 erg = 1g cm2/s^2

## Facts of lights
- light in a vacuum always moves at the same speed of $c = 300,000 km/s$
- light can act both as a particle and as a wave.
	- a photon is a particle of light
- light us an ELECTROMAGNETIC wave.
- ELECTROMAGNETIC waves interact with charged particles.

## Wavelength
- units are cm(or nanometers or Angstroms)
## frequency 
- frequency is the num of waves passing any point each second.
## Speed
- km/s

## Energy
- units in J

## Properties of Light
wavelength and freq are inversely porp.$$\lambda = \frac{c}{f}$$
Energy and freq are directly proportional $$ E = hf$$
$$h = 6.6 \times 10^-34 j/sec$$
## The electromagnetic spectrum
- long wavelength are redder
- short wavelength are bluer

## making a spectrum
- A prism bends light of different wavelength by different angles producing the spectrum.
# Spectra
a spectrum is a map of how much light is emitted at each wavelength.
# Thermal radiation

## What is thermal radiation

- humans emit lights in infrared.
$$B_v(v,T ) = \frac{2hv^3}{c^2} \times \frac{1}{e^\frac{hv}{kt} - 1}$$

if its hotter, its peak is at a shorter wavelength. it has a higher surface brightness.

-  blue star  -> high temp star (18000k)

## why  hotter = bluer?
- E = X x kT
- higher temp <-> higher energy <-> shorter wavelength(bluer)
$$\lambda = \frac{hc}{E} = \frac{hc}{XkT} = 2900000 nm / T$$

$$\lambda_{peak} = 2900000 /T$$
- T in kelvin 
- lambda in nm
- Wien law hotter means a bluer peak

## Energy, Power, Flux
E : unit in J
Luminosity/Power: energy emitted per second
Units are Watts(W) 1 watt = 1 J/sec
Flux or surface brightness: power emitted per square meter $(W/m^2)$g

Luminosity is surface brightness multiplied by surface area

## Rule #2 of thermal radiation
If its hotter, it has a higher surface brightness.

Surface brightness = $\sigma T^4$
(hotter means higher surface brightness)

# Telescope
## Detecting Faint Objects
- build bigger telescopes
- use better detectors
- larger CCD 
- choosing your site wisely
	- darker place better
- Harder to see detail in distant objects.
- Diffraction limit (angular resolution)of a telescope or your eye is set by its diameter (size)
	- $\theta_{limit} \sim \phi \\/ D$
	- bigger D means reslove more object
	- our eye has a limit of around 2 arcmin
	- many astronomical object have size of arcseconds 

## Another path to bigger telescope
use fancy techniques:
- in radio you can use interferometry to combine many telescopes to act as one very big telescope
- this gives you great angular resolution 
	- telescope diameter are measured in km
- improve angular resolution but not change in amount data collection
- Using fancy techniques : adaptive optics
### Turbulence in the atmosphere "bluer" our view of distant objects 
## Things we want from tele
- make the as big as possible
- as much wavelength as possible
## what do astronomes do with telescopes
- imaging 
- spectroscopy :
- Time monitoring: measuring how light output varies with tiem
-
