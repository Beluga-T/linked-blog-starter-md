In the scene where Diouana joyfully reminisces about her life in Senegal, walking hand-in-hand with her boyfriend while wearing the dress given to her by her French employer, the contrast between hope and disillusionment becomes evident. Diouana is excitedly telling her boyfriend about her plans to go to France, a place she envisions as full of opportunity and glamour. Her happiness, expressed through her playful jumping on the edge of a staircase, reflects her youthful optimism and belief in a brighter future abroad. This moment, however, is laden with tragic irony, as the audience already knows the harsh reality awaiting her in France.

The filmmakers use visual symbolism and flashback structure to emphasize this shift between Diouana’s hopeful dreams and the oppressive life she ends up facing. In this scene, the dress is a powerful symbol. While it initially represents the allure of France and upward mobility, it later becomes a reminder of Diouana’s objectification and loss of agency. The filmmakers also employ camera movement and framing to underscore her fleeting freedom. As she jumps on the staircase edge, the camera captures her from a low angle, emphasizing her sense of triumph and excitement in this moment.

I did some research on the background of Black Girl. It's said that the postcolonial condition faced by African nations and their people during the 1960s. The film critiques the exploitative relationship between former colonial powers and the African diaspora. At the time of the film’s release, many African countries were newly independent but still economically and socially tied to their colonizers. Diouana’s story embodies this postcolonial struggle—her dream of a better life in the metropole is shattered by systemic racism and dehumanization.
