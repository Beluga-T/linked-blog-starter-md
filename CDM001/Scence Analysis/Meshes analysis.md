It makes me feel like it's trying to tell me something-the woman walking on the road, picking a flower, and, in the end, getting inside a house. There's introduction of objects here: the key, the knife, the flower-recurring during the movie in a way that obscures reality from dream. This scene felt for me as a kind of prologue of falling into some kind of dream from the very protagonist of this movie. Immediately, the film displaces the viewer's sense of time and space, hinting that what is on-screen is a representation of the woman's subconscious at work, rather than any kind of coherent narrative. The key and flower foreshadow recurring motifs of control, desire, and entrapment. 

The opening uses long, slow shots of the woman's walk down the path. The tracking shot of her keeps the viewer apart, as though they are in an outside position observing her. This distance works against the later scenes where close-ups have been used as an indication that there is now subjective perception to the objective reality of the opening shots. Also, the extreme close-up of the flower isolates it as a symbolic object, which is far more important than the presence of flowers themselves. The shallow focus applied here aligns with the surrealist tone of the film and presents the world in a fragmented, dreamlike fashion.

The flower, the key, and later the knife that gets introduced into the scene form an important part of the symbolic language in the movie. The flower on the road looks natural but also somehow deliberate, a trap. It starts off the events that happen thereafter when she picks it up-a catalyst in entering a liminal space wherein reality dissolves. The house she enters feels both strangely familiar and alien; the scanty furnishings and stark lighting of the interior evoke a sense of unease. The dropping and retrieving of the key both proclaims an act of control and its converse, the loss of control-a suggestion to the cyclical patterns and psychological entrapment of the protagonist.
