In the film _Rear Window_ (1957), Rear Window reveals elements of privacy, voyeurism, and moral ambiguity in the relationship between Jeff and Lisa Thorwald. The moment of their acquaintance with Lars Thorwald represents a complete turn in their relations from the mere peeping to active confrontation. Further on, it would be appropriate to focus on the meaning of Lisa's act, the formal methods Alfred Hitchcock used, and how such a movie expressed post-war suburban anxieties.

The Thorwalds, on the other hand, exist in an apartment filled with impeccable decor, reeking of order and control. This setting reinforces the era's values of neatness and social niceties which mask hidden dangers. The movie criticizes a growing paranoia related to strangers and unspeakable secrets, an anxiety heightened within the cultural ambiance of early Cold War tensions.

At that pivotal moment in the film, Lisa decides that she needs to take a far more active approach, no longer just watching this but actually having a confrontation with Lars. As Lisa takes upon herself the personal responsibility of the delivery of this letter, Lisa confronts the passivity that Jeff had come to represent in her and begins to assert independence from those prescribed traditional gender roles of the post-war era.

Hitchcock has used crosscutting to provide a sense of duality between Jeff and Lisa. The movie cuts from Jeff's tense expressions to Lisa's calm manner as she approaches the door, which creates audience-aware tension and increases suspense. Wide shots of the courtyard featuring Lisa's vulnerability are juxtaposed with close-ups on Jeff looking on with growing anxiety. This juxtaposition underlines their emotional journey-from passivity to active confrontation.

The film critiques the surveillance culture prevalent in post-war America, where privacy was increasingly under threat. Lisa's act is a challenge to the conventions, reflecting a widening awareness of unseen dangers and the crumbling of established female roles. She represents an end to meek dependence and the adoption of positive action through her putting herself in danger, which mirrors changes in broader cultural shifts at the time.

In conclusion, this scene analysis highlights the film's exploration of themes through its characters' actions, Hitchcock's formal techniques, and cultural reflections, offering a comprehensive view of Rear Window's impact and relevance.

### 3.1. SYNTAX OF THE LAMBDA-CALCULUS

Matching parentheses may be dropped or added for convenience. Here are some examples of $\lambda$-terms (and their abbreviation):

$$\begin{aligned}
& y \\
& (yx) \\
& \lambda x. (yx) \\
& (\lambda x. (yx)) \\
& (((\lambda x. (\lambda y. (yx))) ) z) \\
& (((\lambda x. (\lambda y. (yx))) ) z) w)
\end{aligned}$$Note that$\lambda x. \, yx$is an abbreviation for$\lambda x. (yx)$, not $(\lambda x. yx)$.

The variables occurring in a $\lambda$-term are free or bound.
