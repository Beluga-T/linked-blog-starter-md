In Cléo from 5 to 7, the central character, Cléo, departs a bar and walks through the Parisian streets, the camera alternating between her perspective and the glances of various pedestrians. This shot, at the point of transformation in the film, emphasizes issues of surveillance, objectification, and self-consciousness. My interpretation is that the scene is used to highlight Cléo's increasing sensitivity to the way she is perceived by other individuals and leads her to think about her life beyond her looks. The cross-cutting creates tension, and the viewer is left positioned both as observer and witness.  

A technique employed here is the use of eyeline matches. By intercutting between Cléo and the onlookers, Varda establishes a visual dialogue which involves the spectator in the gaze. This method compels the onlookers to be compelled to cope with the dynamics of the gaze and its implications on Cléo's identity. In addition, Varda employs real-time tracking shots, imparting the scene with documentary-type realism and enhancing Cléo's perception of being under constant surveillance. The mise-en-scène, for example, the vibrant but indifferent Parisian streets, is contrasted with Cléo's internal struggle and highlights her isolation amidst the crowds.  

In the early 1960s, Cléo from 5 to 7 is a work of the French New Wave era, an era of innovative filmmaking techniques and narratives that challenged traditional conventions. Agnès Varda, at times called the "Grandmother of the New Wave," employed this film to subvert cultural notions of femininity and women's objectification. The above scene is indicative of the ubiquitous cultural gaze that prescribes and limits women's roles and identities. Varda's presentation of Cléo's trajectory is reflective of the new feminist discourse of the time, subverting patriarchal structures and redefining women's autonomy and self-definition.  

In Feminist Film Theory and Cléo from 5 to 7, Hilary Neroni examines how Varda's film serves as a touchstone text for feminist film. Neroni contends that the film works through the contradictions of social expectations for women, the tension between being observed and being an agent. She argues that Varda subverts the traditional cinematic imagery by bestowing upon Cléo a richness of subjectivity that defies the passive position conventionally granted to female characters. This interpretation harmonizes with the presentation of Cléo's growing conscious of self and refusal to be simply an object of the look.  

Lastly, this scene demonstrates how Varda employs cinematographic methods to critique and dismantle the complexity of social conceptions regarding women. The relationship between Cléo and her observers not only propels the movie but serves as a reaction to the additional meaning of the gaze in cinema and society as well.
