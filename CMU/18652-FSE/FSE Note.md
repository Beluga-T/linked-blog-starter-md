### problem1 :
kanban don't have fix role
scrum has defined role : scrum master,  product owner, and dev team


### problem 2:
Kanban: working progress limit
scrum : time constraint has fix length: 30 days

### problem 3: Approaches
`Kanban`: visualize workflow(kanban board) , work in progress limitation,  measure and optimize flow(lead time),defer commitment
- defer commitment: (LRM)Last Responsible Moment, (YAGNI)You Arenâ€™t Gonna Need It.
- lead time : total time from selected stage to done stage 
---
`Scrum`: product backlog, sprint planning, estimation, sprint backlog, sprint review, sprint retrospective, iterations(sprints), standup meeting velocity.

- Velocity: sprint meeting estimated items difficulty. Sum it up to velocity.
