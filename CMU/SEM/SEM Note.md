XP Principle:


Humanity: Acknowledge human needs, and leverage human strength. Team members have basic human needs such as safety, accomplishment, belonging, growth, and intimacy. Balance the needs of individuals with the needs of the team.

Practices supporting this principle include ‘Energized work’ (see definition below).

  

Economics: Development must have business value, meet business goals and serve business needs. For example, solving the highest priority business need first maximizes the value of the project.

Practices supporting this principle include ‘Real Customer Involvement’ (see definition below).

  

Mutual Benefit: This is the most important and difficult principle. Every activity should benefit all concerned, now and in the future.

Practices (to be done during class activity; identify one or two primary and/or corollary practices that support this principle):

  

Self-Similarity: Try copying the structure of a solution that works well in one context into a new context, even at different scales. This applies to work flows, design patterns and architectural styles.

Practices:

  

Improvement: In software development perfect is a verb, not an adjective. No process, design or artifact is perfect. You can, however, perfect your process, design and artifacts. Excellence is achieved by means of continuous improvement. Find a reasonable starting place, get started and improve from there.

Practices:

  

Diversity: Teams where everyone is alike, while comfortable, are not effective. Teams need diversity. Teams need to bring together a variety of skills, attitudes, and perspectives to see problems and pitfalls, to think in multiple ways to solve problems, and to implement the solutions.

Practices:

  

Reflection: Good teams don’t just do their work. They think about how they are working and why they are working. They analyze why they succeeded or failed. They don't try to hide their mistakes, but expose them and actively learn from them.

Practices:

  

Flow: Flow is delivering a sustainable stream of valuable software by engaging in all activities of development simultaneously. The practices of XP are biased towards a continuous flow of activities rather than discrete phases.

Practices:

  

Opportunity: To reach excellence, problems need to turn into opportunities for learning and improvement, not just survival. This principle helps maximize strengths and minimize weaknesses. Consciously choose to transform each problem into an opportunity: an opportunity for personal growth, deepening relationships, and improved software.

Practices:

  

Redundancy: The critical, difficult problems in software development should be solved in several different ways using different practices; that way, even if one solution fails utterly, the other solutions will prevent disaster.

Practices:

  

Failure: If you are having trouble succeeding, fail. Failure is not a waste, if it imparts knowledge. Knowledge is valuable and sometimes hard to come by, sometimes it requires failure. 

Practices:

  

Quality: Sacrificing quality is not effective as a means of control. Quality is not a control variable. Projects do not go faster by accepting lower quality. They do not go slower by demanding higher quality. Pushing quality higher often results in faster delivery; while lowering quality standards often results in later, less predictable delivery.

Practices:

  

Baby Steps: What is the least you could do that is recognizably in the right direction? Individuals and teams can make many small steps so rapidly that they appear to be leaping. 

Practices:

  

Accepted Responsibility: Responsibility cannot be assigned; it can only be embraced, by teams and individuals. If someone tries to give you responsibility, only you can decide if you are responsible or if you are not. Then you should be fully in charge with full authority.
