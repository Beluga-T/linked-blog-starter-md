**Salvador Dalí’s** *The Persistence of Memory* (1931, oil on canvas)
___
### Symbols & Metaphor
#### Melting Clocks
I believe these soft clocks is the very reason that this painting is famous. The real-world clocks cannot be fluid at all so it implies the scene is about in dreams or other non-real worlds. On the other hand, the clock means times, I think the author want to suggest that time is no more behaves sequentially in dreams. Its fragmented or even meaningless here.

#### Ants Pocket Watches
One of the pocket watches is covered with ants-a recurring symbol in Dalí's work often representing decay or the relentless, erosive nature of time. Their presence underlines the painting's theme of impermanence: ants quite literally consume or break down what is left to rot, hinting that nothing-no object or concept-remains untouched by the passage of time.

#### The Weird Creature
At the center/foreground, there is a strange, pale, amorphous shape with long eyelashes. It may suggest how the author saw himself in dreams. The faceless, dream-like creature personifies the subconscious suggest that beneath our waking reality lies a realm where identity, memory, and even physical form can shift unpredictably.

#### Desolate Landscape
The painting’s background shows a stark, rocky shoreline. The barren landscape emphasizes the dreamlike stage on which time is being distorted. It makes me feel I entered a still, eternal world. Just like the time is frozen/meaningless.
